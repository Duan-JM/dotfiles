# Python Library Packaging

## pyproject.toml Essentials

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "my-package"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Short description"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
license = {text = "MIT"}
dependencies = []

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = ["pytest>=7.0", "ruff>=0.1", "mypy>=1.0"]

[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://github.com/user/package"
Documentation = "https://package.readthedocs.io"

[project.scripts]
mycli = "my_package.cli:main"

[tool.setuptools.packages.find]
where = ["src"]
```

## Building

```bash
pip install build
python -m build              # Creates dist/
twine check dist/*           # Validate
```

## Publishing to PyPI

**First time setup:**
```bash
# Create API token at pypi.org/manage/account/token/
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-xxx...
```

**Publish:**
```bash
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*  # Test first
twine upload dist/*                         # Production
```

## GitHub Actions (Trusted Publishing)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      - run: pip install build && python -m build
      - uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

## Dependency Best Practices

```toml
# DO: Minimum versions
dependencies = ["requests>=2.28", "click>=8.0"]

# DON'T: Exact pins (locks users)
dependencies = ["requests==2.28.1"]

# DO: Optional for features
[project.optional-dependencies]
cli = ["click>=8.0"]
```

## Including Package Data

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
my_package = ["py.typed", "data/*.json"]
```

```python
from importlib.resources import files
data = files("my_package.data").joinpath("file.json").read_text()
```

- **[CONDA.md](CONDA.md)** - Conda packaging guide
