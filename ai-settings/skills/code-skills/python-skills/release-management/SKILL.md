## Version in Code

```python
# src/package/__init__.py
__version__ = "1.2.3"

# Or use importlib.metadata
from importlib.metadata import version
__version__ = version("my-package")
```

## GitHub Actions Release

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      - run: pip install build && python -m build
      - uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: dist/*
      - uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
```

## Deprecation Process

```python
import warnings

def old_function():
    """Deprecated: Use new_function() instead."""
    warnings.warn(
        "old_function() deprecated, will be removed in 2.0.0",
        DeprecationWarning,
        stacklevel=2,
    )
    return new_function()
```

## Release Process

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md (move Unreleased to version)
# 2. Bump version in pyproject.toml and __init__.py
# 3. Commit and tag
git commit -am "Release v1.2.0"
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin main --tags
# 4. CI publishes automatically
```

- **[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)** - Migration guide template
