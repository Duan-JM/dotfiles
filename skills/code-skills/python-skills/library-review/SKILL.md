# Python Library Review

## Quick Health Check (5 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/package && cd package
cat pyproject.toml | head -50        # Modern config?
ls tests/ && pytest --collect-only   # Tests exist?
pytest --cov=package | tail -20      # Coverage?
pip install bandit && bandit -r src/ # Security?
```

## Review Dimensions

| Area | Check For |
|------|-----------|
| Structure | src/ layout, py.typed marker |
| Packaging | pyproject.toml (not setup.py) |
| Code | Type hints, docstrings, no anti-patterns |
| Tests | 80%+ coverage, edge cases |
| Security | No secrets, input validation, pip-audit clean |
| Docs | README, API docs, changelog |
| API | Consistent naming, sensible defaults |
| CI/CD | Tests on PR, multi-Python, security scans |

## Red Flags 🚩

- No tests
- No type hints
- setup.py only (no pyproject.toml)
- Pinned exact versions for all deps
- No LICENSE file
- Last commit > 1 year ago

## Green Flags ✅

- Active maintenance (recent commits)
- High test coverage (>85%)
- Comprehensive CI/CD
- Type hints throughout
- Clear documentation
- Semantic versioning
